# Nouwe Bridge

Nouwe Bridge is a cross-chain bridging solution leveraging Open Intents and Hyperlane. It enables seamless interoperability between blockchains, allowing users to transfer assets and data across different networks efficiently. 

## Hyperlane Registry

This repository includes configurations, artifacts, and schemas related to Hyperlane. See the [Hyperlane documentation](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/registries) for more information.

### Supported Chains

Nouwe Bridge integrates with multiple blockchains via Hyperlane. Recently, the chain was successfully added to the Hyperlane registry, allowing it to participate in cross-chain interactions.

Each supported chain is structured as a folder containing:
- `metadata.yaml`
- `addresses.yaml`
- `logo.svg`

### Deployments

#### Core
Configurations and artifacts for [Hyperlane Core Contract](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/deploy/deploy-hyperlane) deployments.

#### Warp
Address artifacts for [Warp Route](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/deploy/deploy-warp-route) token deployments.

## Contributing

Nouwe Bridge is open for contributions from the community. If youâ€™d like to add new chains, optimize configurations, or enhance interoperability, refer to the [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
